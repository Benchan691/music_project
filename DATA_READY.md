## ⚠️ Note: Shepherd's Flute

The shepherd's flute data is not included yet. You have two options:

### Option 1: Train with Piano & Violin Only (Recommended)
You can start training now with just piano and violin. This is a great starting point!

### Option 2: Add Shepherd's Flute Later
1. Record or download shepherd's flute samples (or substitute: tin whistle, recorder)
2. Name files in format: `C3_001.wav`, `C3_002.wav`, etc.
3. Place in `data/all_samples/shepherds_flute/`
4. Re-run split: `python prepare_data.py split data/all_samples`
5. Re-create metadata: `python prepare_data.py metadata`

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Ready to Train!

```bash
# 1. Activate virtual environment
cd /Users/chankokpan/Documents/Music_project
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Start training (this will take several hours)
python train.py
```

### Training Details
- **Duration**: 2-8 hours (depending on your Mac's performance)
- **Epochs**: 100 (configured in config.py)
- **Batch size**: 32
- **Model size**: ~6 million parameters
- **Hardware**: Will use your M-series chip's GPU acceleration

### During Training
The model will:
- ✅ Load 25,149 training samples
- ✅ Validate on 5,389 samples each epoch
- ✅ Save best model to `models/audio_classifier_model.h5`
- ✅ Generate training history plots
- ✅ Use early stopping if validation loss stops improving

### Expected Performance (with this data)
- **Instrument classification**: 95-98% accuracy
- **Note classification**: 85-92% accuracy
- **Combined accuracy**: 80-88%

## 📈 After Training

### 1. Evaluate Your Model
```bash
python evaluate.py
```
This generates:
- Confusion matrices
- Per-note accuracy plots
- Detailed metrics in `evaluation/` directory

### 2. Try Predictions
```bash
# Command line
python predict.py path/to/audio.wav

# Web interface
python app.py
# Open http://localhost:5000
```

### 3. Live Detection
```bash
python app.py
# Open http://localhost:5000/live
# Real-time microphone detection!
```

## 💾 Disk Space

Your project now uses:
- **NSynth download**: ~22 GB (in ~/Downloads/nsynth-data/)
- **Filtered samples**: ~4-5 GB (in data/ directories)
- **Total**: ~27 GB

You can delete `~/Downloads/nsynth-data/` after confirming training works to save 22 GB.

## 🎯 Training Tips

1. **Monitor Training**:
   - Watch the terminal for epoch progress
   - Check `logs/` directory for TensorBoard logs
   - Training loss should decrease steadily

2. **If Training Stops**:
   - Model automatically saves best weights
   - You can resume or use the saved model

3. **Adjust If Needed**:
   - Edit `config.py` to change batch size, epochs, etc.
   - Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` if you run out of memory

4. **Quality Over Quantity**:
   - Your 36K samples is excellent!
   - More data = better generalization
   - Your note coverage (600+ per note) is very good

## ✨ You're All Set!

Everything is ready for training. Just run:

```bash
cd /Users/chankokpan/Documents/Music_project
source venv/bin/activate
python train.py
```

Good luck with your training! 🎵🤖
